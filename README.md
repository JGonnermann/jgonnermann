## ABOUT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Zuse Institute Berlin](https://www.zib.de/) working in the [IOL Lab](https://www.zib.de/members/pokutta) led by Sebastian Pokutta, where I a, responsible for the research area ['Humans and AI'](https://iol.zib.de/research/iol-human.html).

### About My Research

My work investigates how **agentic AI** and **human-centered AI design** can be integrated to create adaptive and personalized systems that support education, learning, and decision-making, ultimately contributing to positive societal impact.

**Research Focus:**
- Development and evaluation of **large language model (LLM)-based educational tools** and **agentic simulations**
- Experimental approaches collaborating with schools and industry partners to assess the potential and requirements of AI technologies in authentic educational settings
- **Socially-aware AI** and the application of AI in **augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR)** environments to enhance learning experiences
